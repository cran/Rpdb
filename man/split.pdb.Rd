\title{Divide and Reassemble \sQuote{pdb} Objects}
\usage{
\method{split}{pdb}(x, f, drop = FALSE, ...)

\method{unsplit}{pdb}(value, f, drop = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of class \sQuote{pdb} to be divided into groups.}

\item{f}{a \sQuote{factor} in the sense that
\code{\link{as.factor}(f)} defines the grouping, or a list of such factors
in which case their interaction is used for the grouping.}

\item{drop}{logical indicating if levels that do not occur should be
dropped (if \code{f} is a \code{factor} or a list).}

\item{value}{a list of 'pdb' objects compatible with a splitting of
\code{x}. Recycling applies if the lengths do not match.}

\item{\dots}{further potential arguments passed to methods.}
}
\value{
The value returned from \code{split} is a list of \sQuote{pdb}
objects containing the data for the groups of atoms. The components of the
list are named by the levels of \code{f} (after converting to a factor, or if
already a factor and \code{drop=TRUE}, dropping unused levels). \cr 
\code{unsplit} returns a \sQuote{pdb} object for which \code{split(x, f)}
equals \code{value}.
}
\description{
\code{split} divides a \sQuote{pdb} object by groups of atoms defined by 
\code{f}. \code{unsplit} reverses the effect of \code{split}.
}
\details{
\code{split} produce a list of \sQuote{pdb} objects with the same 
\code{cryst1}, \code{title} and \code{remark} components as \code{x}. Only 
its \code{atoms} component is splitted while its \code{conect} component is 
cleaned to keep only the meaningful connectivity for each \sQuote{pdb} object
of the list returned by the function. \code{unlist} produce a \sQuote{pdb} 
object with the same \code{cryst1}, \code{title} and \code{remark} components
as the first element of \code{value}. The \code{atoms} and \code{conect} 
components of all the elements of \code{value} are combined by row.
